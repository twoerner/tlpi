This is my code from reading the (wonderful) book:
	The Linux Programming Interface : a Linux and UNIX system programming handbook
	by Michael Kerrisk
	2010
	ISBN-10: 1-59327-220-0
	ISBN-13: 978-1-59327-220-3
	No Starch Press Inc

Any code named: listing_<ch>-<i>.* (e.g. listing_34-1.c)
	Comes directly from the printed version of the book. Each chapter
	contains numerous example listings to further clarify the concepts
	being explained in the in-line text. Although these listings are not
	100% verbatim copies of Michael's work (I tend to rewrite the code
	a bit to change variable names, or re-order the code somewhat, or
	perhaps "play" with the code) for the most part it is very similar
	to what is found in the book.

	It is safe to say these files are mostly Michael's work and as such
	continue to list him and his chosen licenses.

Any code named: ex_<ch>-<i>.* (e.g. ex_26-1.c)
	Are my attempts at solutions to the various suggested exercises at the
	ends of the given chapters. Sometimes my code works, sometimes it
	doesn't. Sometimes I solve exactly the question being asked, sometimes
	I only do part of it, sometimes I do more than asked.

	Since these represent my own work they're basically licensed in my
	name. For such short snippets I generally prefer a zero-clause
	BSD-style license. I really don't care if you put my name on your
	250,000 line project just because you borrowed 5 lines of code from
	something I wrote. In fact, I'd prefer you don't. By the same token,
	I don't want you blaming me if your project fails because of the 5
	lines of my code you borrowed.

	If you're confused about how to use dup2() and want to use something
	I wrote here as a basis for your own work, go ahead. If I've made a
	mistake I'd appreciate knowing about it, but you shouldn't feel
	required to publicly fork my code and add your fix. Just don't blame
	me if it does something bad for you since you're the one taking this
	code out of context.

Any other files (e.g. doodle_28-1.c)
	Are examples of me not quite fully understanding something and wanting
	to test things out with a real system/compiler/OS, etc.

	As with my exercise solutions, these aren't "real" programs and if you
	need to borrow a line or two, go ahead, just don't blame me for
	anything that my result from you taking my code out of context (zero-
	clause BSD-style).

So what is a zero-clause BSD-style license? Basically just the following parts

	SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

I don't care if you retain this copyright notice in your code.
